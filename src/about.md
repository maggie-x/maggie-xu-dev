# About Me

Hi there!

I'm a full stack engineer driven to build high quality and impactful products!
So far I’ve had 2+ years of experience in frontend frameworks (React, Angular), 1+ year of experience in backend API development (Spring, Kotlin, JVM), 1+ year of experience with AWS.
Currently exploring the world of data analytics and machine learning through side projects and online courses.

## Why do I code?

Ever since my first computer science course at UNSW, I've been inspired by the potential for computers to augment the individual and the community.

## Outside of work

I also have a creative side of me, which is expressed through my interests in UX/UI design, and my hobby passion dance, in particular street dance and hiphop culture 💃.

There is such a vibrant global street dance community all connected through one language, and I hope to travel, dance and meet people around the world!

And also, I love to learning languages, and have studied in Chinese and Japanese 🇨🇳 🇯🇵 .
