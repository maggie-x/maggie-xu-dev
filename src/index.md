I'm **Maggie**, a Full-Stack Software Engineer by day currently navigating the world of Data Analytics and Machine Learning in my spare time.

Deeply inspired by the potential for technology and design to enhance our individual lives, I'm a productivity-freak who uses [Notion](https://notion.so) religiously, and I have a huge appreciation for the field of UX/UI. As such I am constantly striving to design and engineer my life for the better.

Aside from tech, I enjoy dancing, playing sport and travelling.

Currently at AWS building out [AQUA for Redshift (Advanced Query Accelerator)](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/features/aqua/).
